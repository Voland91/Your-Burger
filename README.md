# Your-Burger
First web page created by my own just for fun and practice (it isn't real existing business), you can see demo at:
www.yourburger.pl

My intencion was to create a nice looking web page by my own, using tools wich I'm learning every day.

First stage was to design web page at Photoshop.
Second stage was to implement it as clean HTML & CSS code.

Now when I'm learning JavaScript I'd like to add some extras in JS for practice.

Added some technical and content changes after consulting and code review at some facebook's groups.
