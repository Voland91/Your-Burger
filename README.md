# Your-Burger
First web page created by my own just for fun and practice (it isn't real existing business), you can see demo at:
https://voland91.github.io/Your-Burger/

My intencion was to create a nice looking web page by my own, using tools wich I'm learning every day.

First stage was to design web page at Photoshop.
Second stage was to implement it as clean HTML & CSS code.

Now when I'm learning JavaScript I'd like to add some extras in JS for practice.


// UPDATE 23.10.19 //
Added some technical and content changes after consulting and code review at some facebook's groups.


// UPDATE 24.10.19 //
First JS implementation - added typing text effect at one of the main's text + blinking cursor at the end.


// UPDATE 25.11.19 //
Added some BEM metodology which was most repeated by my code reviewers. I think is great, it is very logical and it shortened my CSS code by more than 100 lines which is awesome!
